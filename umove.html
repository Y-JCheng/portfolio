            <h3>Problem to Solve</h3>
            <p>There are more than 7,000 international students currently study in Ann Arbor. However, most of the interviewees have
                obstacles looking for a place to live. Most of them are considering moving since they don’t have enough knowledge
                about the houses when making decisions. While the satisfaction of housing may influence students’ education
                performances and shouldn’t be neglected, look for solutions for international students to get an ideal house to live
                in is essential.</p>
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>UM Housing site
                <p>UM’s official housing site provides information about on-campus housing and a platform for landlords and the
                    students to pair. It includes structured housing and multi-choice traffic information, but do not optimize
                    information for international students.</p></li>
                <li>MTSA life database
                <p>A wiki-like database constructed by Michigan Taiwanese Student Association (MTSA). Provides comprehensive
                    information needed for Taiwanese students to live in Ann Arbor. The contents are maintained by a few students.
                    Provide cultural information and few housing experiences. However, the quantity of experiences provided stays
                    low, and the information provided isn’t updated.</p></li>
                <li>UMICH Housing, Rooms, Apartments, Sublets
                <p>Students of UM formed a Facebook group as a platform to share housing information. Also, provide the landlords a
                    place to seek for tenants. Communications through Facebook are more convenient than E-mail. However, it still
                    cannot solve the problem of the cultural problems.</p></li>
                <li>Apartment List
                <p>Apartment List is a web-based apartment pairing system. Users provide needs and preferences, and the system
                    provides filtered housing information for the users. The results are highly related to the users’ needs, but
                    cannot help with more complicated tasks like cultural and geographical problems. </p></li>
