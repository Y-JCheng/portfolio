                    Finding a place to live is the very first problem international students are facing, which can highly impact their future development.</h4>
                <p>Studies shows that the satisfaction of housing may influence students’ academic and social development, especially in the first two years. 
                    However, most of international students are having obstacles looking for a place to live. </p>
                <p>
                    This project address the inability of international students to seek for a suitable place to rent. I explore the obstacles these students are facing, and find ways to tackle these challenges with design solutions.

                <div id="interview" class="white">
                    <p>In my research, I drew the attention on Ann Arbor, a classic college town which
                ranked 4 for the popularity of the international students in the states. </p>
                <p>I meet with 4 interviewees and ask them about their experience looking for a place to live in Ann Arbor. During the interview, they are asked to talk about the following:</p>
                <b><ol>
                    <li>Their former living experiences.</li>
                    <li>How they find the place currently live in?</li>
                    <li>Their satisfaction with the place they live in.</li>
                    <li>The most important critirias of looking for a place.</li>
                    <li>What makes them unsatisfied with the current place?</li>
                </ol></b>
                <p>According to the interviews, Most of them are not satisfied with the current place and looking for opportunities to move.</p>
                </div>
                <h4 class="quotes">Also, I conclude these four pain points</h4>
                <div class="deepgray">
                    <h4 class="quotes">Expose to too much Information</h4>
                    <p>There are lots of properties for rent in Ann Arbor, but those information are scatter in different websites. Also, while most of them are not fitting the critirias, international students feel frustrated filter through them one by one.</p>

                <div class="deepgray">
                    <h4 class="quotes">Lack of time for making best decision</h4>
                    <p>Most international students have less than 5 months looking for the room, it may seemed easy, but they have to deal with other problems (including apply for visa, prepare for tuition, etc.) at the same time. Also, these students are mostly doing their jobs or finishing their degrees during the time searching for the rooms.</p>

                <div class="deepgray">
                    <h4 class="quotes">Can't see the room in other countries</h4>
                    <p>Most of the properties do not have enough image for the students to check the environment inside and outside the property. But they are not able to do a room-viewing without being there.</p>

                <div class="deepgray">
                    <h4 class="quotes">Have problems communicate with the landlords</h4>
                    <p>Some of the students are not confident with their English ability, hence they tend to avoid verbal communication with the landlords. This makes it harder for them to get better understanding of the properties.</p>
